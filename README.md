###### How it works
- When the user opens the app, it selects 5 exercises automatically in two modes, random mode and daywise mode, which the user can select. Exercises are fixed in daywise mode.
- Then the user selects the number of sets for each exercise.
- The app displays the list of exercises that user will be doing.
- After the user hits the start button, music starts playing for each exercise. Different music for each exercise.
- There is also a 40 seconds break between each set, and music stops playing to denote a break.
